# Varsity Project 
The website is for students or people in residence who want to order food from their neighbours on an e-commerce website. 
The platform provides a solution to the problem of food waste by allowing students to sell their excess food to others instead of throwing it away. By connecting buyers and sellers within the same residence, the platform reduces the need for food to be transported long distances and potentially wasted in the process. This helps to reduce the amount of food waste generated by students, which is an important environmental and economic issue.
